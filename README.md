# Student Grade Generator
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

# DESCRIPTION FOR GRADE GENERATOR
-Create functions and run prompt in the index.js file.
-Create conditions for each grade.
-Create console.log in order to display the code being integrated.

# Speed Detector
# DESCRIPTION FOR SPEED DETECTOR
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

# Project Setup
-Define speed and call Function of the detector system
-Create function of the demerits point calculator
-Test the code in the console 

 

 # Net Salary Calculator
 # DESCRIPTION FOR NET SALARY CALCULATOR
